This project is a web application for browsing and displaying recipes.
It features a navigation bar with links to different recipe categories (such as pizza, pasta, hamburger, and popcorn).
When a user clicks on a category, the app fetches and displays relevant recipes using data from an external API.
Each recipe is presented in a card format with an image, title, and links for more details and the original source.
Clicking on the "Details" button opens a modal popup with detailed information about the recipe, including ingredients and preparation steps.
The project uses Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness, ensuring a user-friendly experience across different devices.
* NOTE : The project does not focus on HTML and CSS as much as it focuses on using data from an external API
